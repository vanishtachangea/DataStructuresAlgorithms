# DataStructuresAlgorithms
- Practice of Data Structures & Algorithms.
- Solutions to various Coding Problems in C# and Javascript.

I have tackled many questions before but I never put them on a repo such that I lost these solutions eventually. So, the idea is to save all the solutions so that I can refer to them later. But also, I have noticed that there is not many solutions provided in C#, so this repo will be of help to people attempting questions in C#. 
I also found that some problems can be more easily implemented in Javascript.. so I started to try to solve the problems in Javascript, as a way to upgrade my Javascript skills. 

#Coding Platforms
I have used various coding platforms so far.
